once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them So when they were old enough  she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes 

The first little pig was very lazy  He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw  The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks  Then they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day 

The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks  It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney  It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds 

The next day  a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived  and he saw the straw house  and he smelled the pig inside He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water

So he knocked on the door and said 

  Little pig  Little pig 
  Let me in  Let me in 
But the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole so he answered back 

  No  No  No  
  Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin

  Then I'll huff 
  and I'll puff 
  and I'll blow your house down 
So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down  The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could  but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig 

The wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks  and he saw the house  and he smelled the pigs inside  and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make.

So he knocked on the door and said 

  Little pigs  Little pigs 
  Let me in  Let me in 
But the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole so they answered back

  No  No  No 
  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin 
So the wolf showed his teeth and said 

  Then I'll huff 
  and I'll puff 
  and I'll blow your house down 
So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down  The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once  but he was too greedy and got neither  His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them 

The wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them  But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them  The three little pigs they were very frightened  they knew the wolf wanted to eat them  And that was very  very true The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast
