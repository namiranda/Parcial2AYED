once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them so when they were old enough she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes

the first little pig was very lazy he didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw the second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks then they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day

the third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks it was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney it looked like it could withstand the strongest winds

the next day a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived and he saw the straw house and he smelled the pig inside he thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water

so he knocked on the door and said

  little pig little pig
  let me in let me in
but the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole so he answered back

  no no no
  not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin
three little pigs straw house then the wolf showed his teeth and said

  then i'll huff 
  and i'll puff 
  and i'll blow your house down
so he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down the wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig

the wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks and he saw the house and he smelled the pigs inside and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make

so he knocked on the door and said

  little pigs little pigs
  let me in let me in
but the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole so they answered back

  no no no
  not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin
so the wolf showed his teeth and said

  then i'll huff 
  and i'll puff 
  and i'll blow your house down
so he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down the wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once but he was too greedy and got neither his big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them

the wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them but they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them the three little pigs they were very frightened they knew the wolf wanted to eat them and that was very very true the wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast

so the wolf knocked on the door and said

  little pigs little pigs
  let me in let me in
but the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole so they answered back
